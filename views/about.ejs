            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                Global Horizons Tours was founded by a close-knit group of friends with a shared dream: to explore the world's most extraordinary 
                places and bring those experiences to others. Having traveled extensively across continents, we have immersed ourselves in diverse 
                cultures, tasted exotic cuisines, and witnessed natural wonders. Our adventures have sparked a desire to share these incredible 
                experiences with fellow travelers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our journey began with a simple idea—to combine our passion for travel with a commitment to delivering exceptional tours. With 
                backgrounds in adventure travel, cultural studies, and hospitality, we have come together to create a company that values 
                authenticity, adventure, and connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Join us as we continue to explore new horizons and create adventures that will stay with you long after your journey ends. 
                Let us be your guide to the world’s wonders and the stories that make each destination unique.
